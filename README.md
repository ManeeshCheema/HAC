# HAC
This is an implementation of Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering algorithm

Single , Complete and Average Linkage have been implemented from scratch 
without using the Agglomerative Clustering model from Sklearn library

Ward Linkage is also been  implemented using the sklearn library in the end

Euclidean metric have been used for calculating Distances , Manhattan metric can also be used by replacing
'EuclideanDistance' by 'ManhattanDistance'
